Customizing Best Practices
--------------------------
If you would like to adjust the best practice checks, you can place a ``rails_best_practices.yml`` file in
your project directory. You find more information in the
`official documentation <https://github.com/railsbp/rails_best_practices#customize-configuration>`_.
