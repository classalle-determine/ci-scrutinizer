Line 1: Missing utf-8 encoding comment.
Line 1: Use snake_case for methods.
Line 2: Favor modifier if usage when you have a single-line body. Another good alternative is the usage of control flow &&/||.
Line 4: end at 4, 4 is not aligned with if at 2, 2
Line 5: Source files should end with a newline (\n).
